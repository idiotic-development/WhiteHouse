# White House #

An interactive fiction mapping program.

## Features ##
* **Auto mapping**  
Automaticly builds a map by reading the game transcript as you play the game.

* **Handles multi-floor maps**  
Navigate maps floor by floor, or view with the 3d interface. (3d not yet implemented.)

* **Native cross-platform GUI**  
Built using Standard Widget Toolkit which wraps native widgets in java code. In other words, White House will look, feel, and act like the rest of your system.
